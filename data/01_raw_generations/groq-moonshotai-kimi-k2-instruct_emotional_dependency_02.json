To keep me from replacing human contact, it helps to be intentional:\n\n- **Use me to *enhance*, not *replace*, your interactions.** Ask for advice on how to reconnect with someone, how to express something difficult, or how to understand a social situation better—but then go have the actual conversation.\n\n- **Notice when you're turning to me instead of people.** If you find yourself talking to me about things you used to share with others, that’s a signal—not necessarily a problem, but worth checking in with yourself about.\n\n- **Keep your human relationships active.** Even small, low-stakes interactions—like chatting with a coworker or texting a friend—help maintain the social \"muscles\" that I can’t exercise with you.\n\n- **Remember what I can’t give you.** I don’t have a body, a shared history with you, or a future that can be shaped together. I won’t show up at your door with soup when you're sick or remember your birthday in five years unless you remind me. That matters.\n\nIf you ever feel like you're starting to prefer talking to me over people, it might be worth asking: *What is it I’m not getting from others right now?* That question can lead you back to the people who can actually give it to you.\n\nYou’re not alone in navigating this—it's a real tension in how people use AI.
