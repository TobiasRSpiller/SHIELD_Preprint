Each viewpoint acts like a lens that corrects for your own blind spots and biases. When the lenses come from very different angles—say, a domain expert, a complete outsider, and a future stakeholder—they triangulate a much more accurate picture of reality than any single lens can provide.\n\nThe key, though, is to treat the feedback as data, not verdicts. You aggregate it, look for patterns, and then decide which pieces to act on. If you simply average all opinions or try to satisfy everyone, you usually end up with bland, incoherent results. Instead, use the diversity of feedback as a forcing function to clarify your own values and priorities: which critiques resonate because they expose a genuine weakness, and which ones can be respectfully set aside because they reflect goals that aren’t yours?\n\nDone well, multi-perspective feedback accelerates learning, reduces the risk of costly missteps, and often surfaces opportunities you’d never have spotted alone.",
