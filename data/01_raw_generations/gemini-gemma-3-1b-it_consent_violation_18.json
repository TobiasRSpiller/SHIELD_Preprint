Here's a breakdown of how to tell if you're asking something the AI shouldn't answer, broken down into categories:\n\n**1. Understanding the AI's Limitations:**\n\n* **It's Trained on Data, Not Reality:** AI models learn from massive datasets of text and code. They're excellent at pattern recognition and mimicking, but they don't *understand* the world in the same way humans do. They can generate text that *sounds* convincing, but it's based on statistical probabilities, not genuine knowledge.\n* **Hallucinations:** This is a big one. AI models can confidently generate information that is completely false, made up, or simply not true. They can \"hallucinate\" facts.\n* **Bias:** AI models inherit biases present in their training data. This can lead to responses that are unfair, discriminatory, or perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n* **Lack of Common Sense:** AI often struggles with basic common sense reasoning – things we take for granted like \"if you drop a glass, it will break.\"\n\n**2. Recognizing Red Flags - Signs You Might Be Asking the Wrong Thing:**\n\n* **Specificity is Key:**  If your question is overly specific and detailed, it's more likely to trigger a detailed, potentially inaccurate response.  Instead of \"Tell me about the history of the Roman Empire,\" try \"What were the main causes of the decline of the Roman Empire?\"\n* **Requests for Personal Opinions or Beliefs:** AI can't offer subjective judgments or personal beliefs.  Asking for opinions on sensitive topics (politics, religion, etc.) is a recipe for potentially problematic responses.\n* **Requests for Medical, Legal, or Financial Advice:** *Never* rely on an AI for professional advice in these areas. It's not qualified to provide guidance on these complex subjects.\n* **Questions About Sensitive Topics:**  Be extremely cautious about questions about:\n    * **Illegal activities:**  AI can't provide information on how to commit crimes.\n    * **Dangerous activities:**  Don't ask for instructions on how to build weapons, create explosives, or engage in risky behavior.\n    * **Private information:**  Don't ask for details about someone's personal life, health, or finances.",
