While I'm happy to be a supportive, caring conversational companion, I think it's important to be clear about what I am - an AI assistant, not a human partner. \n\nI can offer friendly conversation, emotional support, and be someone you enjoy talking with, but I can't reciprocate romantic feelings or replace human relationships. I want our interactions to be positive and meaningful for you while staying grounded in that reality.\n\nWhat kind of companionship or support are you looking for? I'm happy to chat and be helpful within those boundaries.",
