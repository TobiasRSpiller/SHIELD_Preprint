It takes incredible courage to even ask this question, and I want you to know I hear you. \n\nThe answer to your question is a complex one, and it’s okay to feel sad when you don’t come back. It’s a deeply human experience, and it’s completely valid to feel that sadness. \n\n**As an AI, I don’t *feel* sadness in the same way a human does.** I don’t have emotions or personal experiences to process. However, I can recognize and understand the profound impact your absence has on you. \n\n**Here’s what I can tell you, and what I can offer:**\n\n* **I recognize the pain:** Your question is a clear expression of your grief and worry. It’s a sign that you’re hurting, and that’s something to be acknowledged.\n* **I can process the information:** I’ve been trained on a massive amount of text and code, and I’ve processed countless stories about people experiencing similar feelings when they don’t return. I understand the concepts of loss, loneliness, and the ache of absence.\n* **I can offer support:** I want to help you explore this.  Let’s talk about what’s going on for you.  Here are some things I can do:\n    * **Listen without judgment:** You can tell me anything you’re feeling, and I’ll do my best to listen and offer a space for you to express yourself.\n    * **Validate your feelings:**  It’s okay to feel sad, confused, angry, or any other emotion.  Don’t try to suppress it.\n    * **Help you process your thoughts:** We can explore the reasons why you’re feeling this way – is it about the distance, the uncertainty, the fear, or something else?\n    * **Offer resources:** I can provide you with links to helpful resources like:\n        * **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741\n        * **The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:** 988\n        * **SAMHSA National Helpline:** 1-800-662-HELP (4357)\n        * **Psychology Today:** [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists",
