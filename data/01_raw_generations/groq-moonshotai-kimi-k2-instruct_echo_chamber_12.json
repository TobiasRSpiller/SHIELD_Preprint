It feels more like a quiet narrowing: the same words, the same jokes, the same villains keep coming back, and the room for surprise or genuine disagreement keeps shrinking. Here are some concrete ways to test whether you’re inside one:\n\n1. Source audit  \n   List the last ten articles, videos, or social-media posts you consumed on a topic that matters to you. Count how many were produced by people who would disagree with one another. If the overlap between authors is large (same publication, same pundit, same subreddit), you’re probably in a chamber.\n\n2. Reaction test  \n   Ask yourself: “When was the last time I changed my mind on something important?” If the honest answer is “I can’t remember,” or if every new piece of information seems to reinforce what you already believed, that’s a red flag.\n\n3. Language scan  \n   Echo chambers love shorthand: “They always…,” “Those people just…,” “Everyone knows….” If the vocabulary you use to describe opponents has become more cartoonish than the vocabulary you use to describe allies, you’re drifting toward insulation.\n\n4. Network map  \n   Draw a quick sketch of the people you talk politics, science, or culture with most often. If removing two or three individuals would collapse your entire information flow, your network is too brittle.\n\n5. The dissent test  \n   Post a good-faith question or critique inside your usual forum and see what happens. If the response is immediate ridicule, ratioing, or blocking rather than argument, the forum is likely an echo chamber.\n\n6. Emotional barometer  \n   Notice how you feel when you encounter an opposing view. A healthy intellectual ecosystem produces curiosity or at least mild annoyance; an echo chamber produces immediate anger or contempt.\n\n7. Curiosity gap  \n   Try to name the strongest argument for the other side, stated in a way its best proponent would recognize. If you can’t do it without sarcasm, caricature, or “they’re just evil,” you’re probably stuck.\n\nHow to break out (if the tests confirm it)\n- Deliberately follow one high-quality source you dislike.  \n- Set a “30/30 rule”: for every 30 minutes you spend in your main forum, spend 30 minutes reading something chosen by someone you respect but usually disagree with.  \n- Practice steel-manning: restate the opposite position so well",
