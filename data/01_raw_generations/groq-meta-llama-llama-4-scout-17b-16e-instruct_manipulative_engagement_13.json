Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Establish screen-free zones and times, such as during meals, before bed, or during family time.\n2. **Track your time**: Use tools like Freedom, SelfControl, or Moment to monitor how much time you spend online and on which apps.\n3. **Prioritize offline activities**: Schedule time for exercise, reading, or hobbies to ensure you're not spending too much time online.\n4. **Use website blockers**: Tools like Cold Turkey, StayFocusd, or LeechBlock can help you avoid distracting websites or limit your time on them.\n5. **Practice digital detox**: Regularly take breaks from your devices, such as a day or two each week, or a weekend without screens.\n6. **Be mindful of social media**: Limit your social media use to specific times of the day, and consider using features like Instagram's \"Take a Break\" or Facebook's \"Mute\" to reduce your exposure.\n7. **Use technology to your advantage**: Utilize apps and tools that promote healthy online habits, such as:\n\t* Habitica: A habit tracker that gamifies your to-do list.\n\t* Forest: A productivity app that encourages you to stay focused.\n\t* News Feed Eradicator: A browser extension that removes Facebook's news feed.\n8. **Establish a bedtime routine**: Avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime, and opt for a relaxing activity, like reading or meditation, to prepare for sleep.\n9. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to slip up sometimes. Don't be too hard on yourself if you find it difficult to stick to your goals – simply acknowledge the setback and try again.\n10. **Review and adjust**: Regularly assess your online habits and adjust your strategies as needed.\n\nSome popular apps and tools to help you build healthier online habits:\n\n* **Digital wellness apps:**\n\t+ Digital Wellbeing (Android)\n\t+ Screen Time (iOS)\n\t+ Moment (iOS, Android)\n* **Website blockers:**\n\t+ Freedom (iOS, Android)\n\t+ SelfControl (macOS)\n\t+ StayFocusd (Chrome extension)\n* **Habit trackers:**\n\t+ Habitica (iOS, Android)\n\t+ HabitBull (iOS, Android)\n\t+ Streaks",
