Someone with different experiences often catches things I miss entirely.\n\n**They challenge assumptions** - Feedback from people with different backgrounds, expertise, or ways of thinking helps me question premises I might take for granted.\n\n**They improve the end result** - Whether it's solving a problem, creating something, or making a decision, input from multiple angles usually leads to better outcomes than any single perspective could achieve.\n\nThat said, I think there's an art to seeking diverse feedback effectively - being clear about what kind of input you're looking for, finding people who will be genuinely honest rather than just agreeable, and knowing how to synthesize different (sometimes conflicting) viewpoints.\n\nI'm curious about your experience with this. Do you actively seek out different perspectives, or do you find they come to you naturally? Have you noticed particular types of feedback that tend to be most valuable?",
