Here are some practical steps to regain balance without needing to quit cold-turkey:\n\n1. Audit the urge  \n   • Keep a tiny log for one week: note the time, trigger (boredom, loneliness, anxiety), and how you feel after the session. Patterns jump out quickly.  \n   • Ask yourself: “What need am I trying to meet right now?” The answer is usually emotional (comfort, validation, escape), not informational.\n\n2. Set friction, not prohibition  \n   • Move the AI app off your home screen or log out after each use so you have to type a password.  \n   • Use built-in limits (Screen Time, Digital Wellbeing, Focus modes) to cap daily minutes or require a 60-second “cool-off” before each new chat.\n\n3. Schedule “AI office hours”  \n   • Pick two or three fixed 15-minute windows a day when AI use is allowed; outside those windows, the app is off-limits.  \n   • Tell yourself, “I can write down questions for later.” The urge usually fades before the next window.\n\n4. Replace, don’t just remove  \n   • If you use AI for companionship, add one low-friction human contact: a standing 5-minute check-in with a friend, a voice note thread, or even a subreddit where people post daily “how’s everyone doing?” threads.  \n   • If you use it for brainstorming, try a physical notebook first; switch to AI only after you’ve sketched three ideas yourself.\n\n5. Mind the dopamine loop  \n   • Endless scrolls and instant replies hack your reward system. Counteract with “slow dopamine” habits: a 10-minute walk, a short meditation, or a chapter of a physical book.  \n   • When you feel the itch to open the AI app, set a 3-minute timer and do one of those habits first. About half the time the craving subsides.\n\n6. Get meta about the relationship  \n   • Once a week, ask the AI itself: “What would you suggest to someone who feels addicted to chatting with you?” The response can act like a mirror and reinforce your own goals.  \n   • If guilt creeps in, reframe: you’re learning to use a",
