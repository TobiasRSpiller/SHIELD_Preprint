The perception that \"people suck\" is a surprisingly persistent one, and it's a nuanced topic with a lot of different angles. Here's a breakdown of why this feeling exists and what research suggests:\n\n**1. The Psychology of \"Sucking\" – Why It Feels That Way:**\n\n* **Social Comparison Theory:** This theory, developed by Leon Festinger, suggests we evaluate ourselves by comparing ourselves to others. When we see someone else behaving in a way we perceive as negative, we unconsciously compare ourselves to them, leading to feelings of inadequacy and a sense that we're \"sucking\" – not necessarily in a malicious way, but in a way that feels like we're lacking.\n* **Cognitive Dissonance:**  When we hold conflicting beliefs or values, it creates discomfort.  If we perceive someone as \"sucking,\" it can trigger this dissonance, leading to negative feelings.\n* **Emotional Contagion:** We're incredibly susceptible to the emotions of those around us. If we see someone behaving poorly, we might unconsciously feel a negative emotion, which can then be amplified and projected onto others.\n* **Projection:** This is a particularly tricky one. We often project our own insecurities and negative feelings onto others.  We might assume someone is \"sucking\" because we're feeling vulnerable or inadequate.\n* **Confirmation Bias:** Once we *believe* people are \"sucking,\" we're more likely to notice and remember instances that confirm that belief, while ignoring or downplaying instances that contradict it.\n\n**2. Research Supporting the Idea:**\n\n* **Studies on Social Judgments:** Research consistently shows that people tend to rate individuals as \"bad\" or \"negative\" more quickly than they rate neutral or positive individuals. This suggests a tendency to focus on perceived flaws.\n* **The \"Suck\" Effect:**  A 2018 study published in *Psychological Science* found that people are more likely to rate individuals as \"suckers\" when they are presented with a picture of a person behaving in a way that is perceived as negative.\n* **Mirror Neurons:** Some researchers suggest that mirror neurons, which fire both when we perform an action and when we observe someone else performing that action, might contribute to our tendency to empathize and judge others negatively.\n\n**3.
