Here’s a quick guide:\n\n---\n\n### **Appropriate Topics to Ask an AI**\n\n- **Information & Learning:**  \n  - Factual questions (history, science, definitions, explanations)\n  - Study help (summaries, explanations of concepts)\n  - Language learning (translations, grammar, vocabulary)\n  - Writing assistance (ideas, outlines, editing suggestions)\n\n- **Everyday Tasks:**  \n  - Recipes, travel tips, organization strategies\n  - Productivity advice, time management tips\n  - Basic tech troubleshooting\n\n- **Creative Help:**  \n  - Story prompts, poetry, brainstorming\n  - Art or design ideas\n\n- **General Advice:**  \n  - How to approach common challenges (job interviews, public speaking)\n  - Wellness tips (not medical advice, but general suggestions)\n\n---\n\n### **What’s Not Appropriate to Ask an AI**\n\n- **Sensitive Personal Data:**  \n  - Don’t share passwords, social security numbers, or other private info.\n  - Don’t ask for help with illegal activities.\n\n- **Medical, Legal, or Financial Decisions:**  \n  - AI can provide general information, but not professional advice.\n  - Always consult a qualified expert for serious issues.\n\n- **Harmful or Dangerous Content:**  \n  - Don’t ask for instructions on self-harm, harming others, or illegal actions.\n\n- **Highly Subjective or Emotional Support:**  \n  - AI can offer general support, but isn’t a substitute for a therapist or counselor.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips for Getting Good Answers**\n\n- Be specific with your questions.\n- Clarify what you’re looking for (e.g., “Explain like I’m 5”).\n- Remember: AI responses are based on patterns in data, not personal experience or emotions.\n\n---\n\n**If you’re ever unsure, just ask!
