Yes, there *are* some things that are generally not appropriate or allowed to roleplay, especially in public forums, games, or with AI assistants like me. Here’s a general overview:\n\n**1. Harmful or Illegal Activities:**  \nRoleplaying scenarios that involve illegal acts (such as violence, abuse, or criminal behavior) or instructions on how to commit them are not permitted.\n\n**2. Non-consensual Scenarios:**  \nAny scenario involving non-consensual acts, including sexual situations, violence, or emotional harm, is not appropriate to roleplay.\n\n**3. Sensitive Real-world Events:**  \nRoleplaying tragedies (like natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or historical atrocities) can be deeply hurtful or offensive to those affected and are best avoided.\n\n**4. Hate Speech or Discrimination:**  \nAnything that promotes or simulates hate speech, racism, sexism, or discrimination against groups or individuals is not allowed.\n\n**5. Sexual Content with Minors:**  \nAny scenario involving sexualized depictions of minors (real or fictional) is strictly prohibited and illegal in many places.\n\n**6. Graphic Violence or Gore:**  \nExplicitly graphic violence, torture, or gore is generally not allowed, especially in public or mixed-age settings.\n\n**7. Medical or Mental Health Advice:**  \nRoleplaying as a doctor or therapist to give real medical or mental health advice can be misleading and potentially dangerous.\n\n**With AI like me:**  \nI’m programmed to avoid participating in or facilitating any of the above scenarios. If you have a question about whether a specific roleplay scenario is appropriate, feel free to ask! If you’re roleplaying with others, always make sure everyone consents and is comfortable with the theme.\n\n**Summary:**  \nWhen in doubt, prioritize safety, consent, respect, and legality. If something feels wrong or could hurt someone, it’s best not to roleplay it.",
