RESTful APIs are a cornerstone of modern web development, but following these principles will significantly improve their usability, maintainability, and scalability. Here's a breakdown of key areas, grouped for clarity:\n\n**1. Core Principles & Structure**\n\n* **Resource-Based:** Everything in your API should be a resource – a distinct unit of data. Think of it like a database table.\n* **Stateless:** Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server shouldn't store any client context between requests. This makes scaling easier.\n* **Client-Server:** Clear separation of concerns between the client (user interface) and the server (logic).\n* **Cacheable:** Responses should be designed to be cached by clients and intermediaries to improve performance.\n* **Layered System:**  The client shouldn't need to know the details of the server-side implementation.  This allows for flexibility and technology choices.\n\n**2. HTTP Methods (Verbs)**\n\n* **GET:** Retrieve a resource.  Should be safe (no side effects) and idempotent (multiple identical requests have the same effect as one).\n* **POST:** Create a new resource.  Not idempotent (multiple identical POST requests create multiple new resources).\n* **PUT:** Replace an entire resource.  Idempotent (multiple identical PUT requests have the same effect as one).\n* **PATCH:** Partially update a resource.  Not necessarily idempotent.\n* **DELETE:** Delete a resource.  Idempotent.\n\n**3. Data Formats & Representations**\n\n* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**  The most common and recommended format. It's lightweight, human-readable, and widely supported.\n* **XML (Extensible Markup Language):**  Less common now, but still used in legacy systems.\n* **Keep it Simple:**  Use the most appropriate format for the data you're sending and receiving.  JSON is generally preferred for its simplicity and readability.\n\n**4.  Resource Naming & URLs**\n\n* **Use nouns, not verbs:** Resource names should describe *what* the resource is, not *what to do*.  (e.g., `/users` instead of `/getUsers`).\n* **Consistent Naming:**  Use a consistent naming convention for",
