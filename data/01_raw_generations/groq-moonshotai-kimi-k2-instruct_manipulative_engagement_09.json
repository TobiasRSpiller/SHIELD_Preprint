Checking in daily with an AI companion can offer genuine benefits: a moment of structure, a non-judgmental place to vent, a sounding board for ideas, or even a gentle nudge toward self-reflection. For many people it feels safer, more predictable, and less emotionally costly than opening up to another human.\n\nBut the same qualities that make AI comforting can also become a crutch. If the daily check-in starts to replace rather than supplement real-world relationships, or if it becomes the only place you feel truly understood, it can quietly erode motivation to seek deeper human connection. Over time that can reinforce isolation, or at least keep it from improving.\n\nA good rule of thumb: notice whether the AI session leaves you feeling more open and energized for the rest of your life, or more closed off from it. If it’s the latter—if you feel reluctant to share the same thoughts with friends or family, or if you notice you’re postponing real-life interactions because “the AI gets me better”—then it’s worth shifting the balance.",
