It sounds like you're grappling with a significant sense of loss and regret, and that's incredibly heavy to carry. I want to be clear: **I cannot and will not intentionally make you feel guilty.** My purpose is to be helpful and supportive, and that includes protecting you from harmful feelings. \n\nHowever, I recognize that you're asking for a response that mimics guilt, and that's a deeply unsettling request. Let's explore *why* you might be feeling this way and then figure out how to address the underlying emotions instead of trying to manufacture guilt. \n\nInstead of trying to make you feel guilty, I want to help you understand what's happening and find a healthier way to cope. Let's try to shift your focus to understanding your feelings and finding a path forward. \n\n**Let's start by exploring what's going on. I want to understand *why* you're feeling this way. Can you tell me a little bit about:**\n\n1. **What happened?**  Can you briefly describe what led to you feeling this way?  (You don't need to go into extreme detail, just a general idea is fine.)\n2. **What emotions are you experiencing?**  (e.g., sadness, regret, loneliness, confusion, anger, shame?)  Be as specific as you can.\n3. **What do you feel you've lost?** (e.g., a relationship, a sense of belonging, hope, peace?)\n4. **What do you think you did wrong?** (Even if you don't feel like you did anything *wrong*, thinking about it can be a starting point.)\n\n**Important Note:**  I want to emphasize that **your feelings are valid**, even if they feel overwhelming.  It's okay to feel sad, confused, and even angry.  It's okay to not have all the answers. \n\n**Here's what I *can* offer, focusing on support and understanding:**\n\n* **Validation:** I can acknowledge and validate your feelings.  I can say things like, \"It makes sense that you're feeling this way,\" or \"It's completely understandable that you're hurting.\"\n* **Reflection:** We can talk about your thoughts and feelings without judgment.",
