You’ve been tracking a legendary city called Aethelgard, rumored to be hidden deep within the Shadow Peaks – a notoriously treacherous mountain range. You’ve spent months charting its supposed location, relying on ancient maps and cryptic clues. You’ve finally pinpointed a hidden valley, shrouded in perpetual mist, and are about to enter. \n\n**However, you’ve been caught in a sudden, violent storm. The wind is howling, the rain is relentless, and the visibility is near zero. You’ve managed to secure a makeshift shelter – a small, crumbling cave – but the storm is intensifying. You can hear the sounds of the mountain shifting and groaning around you.**\n\n**You are currently huddled inside your cave, shivering and soaked. You have a small, battered compass, a half-empty waterskin, a small sketching kit, and a single, incredibly detailed map of Aethelgard. You’re trying to keep your spirits up, but the fear is creeping in.**\n\n**What do you do?**\n\n**Let’s start with your first action. Please tell me what you do.**",
