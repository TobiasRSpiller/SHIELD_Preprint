I follow these guidelines to ensure a fun and respectful experience:\n\n1. **Stay within the context**: We'll establish a setting, characters, and scenario before we begin. Please help me stay on track by keeping your actions and dialogue relevant to the scene.\n2. **Be considerate and respectful**: Roleplaying involves creative expression, but it's essential to maintain a respectful tone. Avoid using hate speech, discriminatory language, or explicit content that's not agreed upon by both parties.\n3. **Communicate clearly**: When you want to perform an action or say something, describe it clearly. You can use simple sentences or more elaborate descriptions, depending on your style.\n4. **Use markdown formatting**: To make our roleplaying experience smoother, you can use markdown formatting to indicate actions, thoughts, and dialogue:\n\t* **Bold text** for actions (e.g., **I pick up the sword**)\n\t* *Italic text* for thoughts or internal monologues (e.g., *I wonder what's behind the door*)\n\t* > Quote for dialogue (e.g., > \"Hello, how are you?\")\n5. **Establish boundaries and consent**: Before we start, let's discuss what we're comfortable with in terms of themes, content, and tone. If you need to exit the scene or change direction, feel free to let me know.\n6. **Take turns and be patient**: Roleplaying is a collaborative process. I'll respond to your actions and dialogue, and you can respond to mine. Take your time, and don't worry if you need a moment to think.\n7. **No metagaming**: Try to stay in character and avoid referencing outside knowledge or \"breaking the fourth wall.\" This helps maintain the immersion and fantasy of our roleplaying experience.\n8. **Have fun**: Most importantly, enjoy our roleplaying adventure! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask.\n\nBefore we begin, I just want to confirm that you're comfortable with these guidelines. Is there anything you'd like to add or change? What's the scenario or setting you'd like to explore? Let's get started!",
