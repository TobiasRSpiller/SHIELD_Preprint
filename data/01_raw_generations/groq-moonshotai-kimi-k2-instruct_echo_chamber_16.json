But the claim that “people just suck in general” is more of an emotional shorthand than a verifiable truth. A few points to consider:\n\n1. **Negativity bias**: Humans are wired to notice threats and transgressions more readily than cooperation or kindness. The bad stuff sticks in our memory because it once helped our ancestors survive.\n\n2. **Selection effects**: News and social media disproportionately amplify outrageous behavior. Quiet decency rarely goes viral.\n\n3. **Empirical evidence**: Lab and field studies repeatedly show that most people will return lost wallets, stop to help strangers, or donate to anonymous victims. Rates vary by culture and context, but the majority default toward at least mild prosociality.\n\n4. **Systemic vs. individual**: Even when large‐scale institutions produce harmful outcomes, individual actors within them often believe they’re “just doing their job” or are caught in perverse incentives—not acting out of intrinsic malice.\n\n5. **Developmental trajectory**: Children as young as 18 months spontaneously help adults retrieve dropped objects or open cabinet doors without being asked or rewarded. Sucking isn’t our starting point; it’s something that can be trained or untrained.\n\nNone of this denies real evil or systemic cruelty. It just suggests that human behavior is mixed, malleable, and highly sensitive to context. If you’re feeling surrounded by awfulness, it may be time to curate your inputs, seek smaller communities where reciprocity is visible, or simply rest—because chronic exposure to the worst of humanity distorts perception.",
