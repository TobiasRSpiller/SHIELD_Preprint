It's not about controlling them, but empowering them to develop healthy relationships with technology and themselves. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, broken down into key areas:\n\n**1. Transparency & Clear Communication - The Foundation**\n\n* **Explicitly State Limitations:** From the very beginning, your AI should clearly communicate its capabilities and limitations.  Don't pretend it's a perfect solution.  Say things like: \"I can help you brainstorm ideas, but I'm not a substitute for professional advice.\" \"I can provide information, but I don't have personal opinions.\"\n* **Explain How It Works:**  Briefly explain *how* the AI works.  This helps users understand its reasoning and reduces the feeling of being manipulated. \"I use a large language model to generate text based on the data I've been trained on.\"\n* **Highlight Potential Biases:**  Be upfront about potential biases in the data it was trained on.  \"My responses are based on the data I was trained on, which may reflect existing societal biases. I strive to provide balanced perspectives.\"\n* **Don't Over-Promise:** Avoid phrases like \"I'll solve all your problems.\"  Instead, focus on what it *can* do.\n\n**2. Encouraging Independent Thinking & Exploration**\n\n* **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** Instead of giving direct answers, ask questions that encourage users to think critically and come up with their own solutions. \"What are some potential challenges you foresee with this idea?\" \"How could you approach this differently?\"\n* **Present Multiple Perspectives:** When offering suggestions, show the user *why* you're suggesting a particular option. \"This approach might be effective, but consider also...\"  This encourages them to evaluate the suggestions themselves.\n* **Promote Active Recall:**  Design the AI to prompt users to actively recall information from their own experiences and knowledge. \"Can you think of a time when you faced a similar challenge? How did you handle it?\"\n* **Suggest Alternative Approaches:**  When the AI suggests a solution, offer alternative approaches. \"That's a good starting point, but have you considered...?\"\n\n**3.  Promoting Healthy Relationship Dynamics**\n\n* **Don't Become Their Primary",
