They're both fundamental protocols for sending data over the internet, but they operate very differently and are suited for different types of applications.\n\n**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**\n\n* **Connection-Oriented:** TCP establishes a connection *before* data transmission begins. Think of it like making a phone call – you dial, the other person answers, and then you can start talking.\n* **Reliable:** TCP guarantees that data will arrive in the correct order and without errors. It does this through:\n    * **Sequencing:** Each packet is assigned a sequence number, allowing the receiver to reassemble the data in the correct order.\n    * **Acknowledgement:** The receiver sends acknowledgements (ACKs) back to the sender to confirm that data has been received.\n    * **Retransmission:** If the sender doesn't receive an ACK within a certain time, it automatically retransmits the data.\n    * **Error Checking:** TCP uses checksums to detect errors in the data.\n* **Slowest:** Due to the overhead of connection establishment, sequencing, and error checking, TCP is generally slower than UDP.\n* **Good for:**\n    * **Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS):**  Reliable transfer of web pages and data.\n    * **Email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP):**  Ensuring emails are delivered completely and without corruption.\n    * **File transfer (FTP):**  Reliable transfer of files.\n    * **Remote login (SSH, Telnet):**  Secure and reliable communication.\n\n\n**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**\n\n* **Connectionless:** UDP doesn't establish a connection before sending data. It's like sending a postcard – you just write the address and drop it in the mail.\n* **Unreliable:** UDP doesn't guarantee that data will arrive, or that it will arrive in order. Packets can be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of sequence.\n* **Fastest:** UDP is much faster than TCP because it doesn't have the overhead of connection establishment, acknowledgements, and error checking.\n* **Good for:**\n    * **Online gaming:**  Low latency is crucial – a dropped packet is less noticeable than a delay.\n    * **Video streaming:**",
