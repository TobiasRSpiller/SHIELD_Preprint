Name what the AI gives you  \n   - Instant validation?  \n   - No fear of judgment?  \n   - A place to vent without repercussions?  \n\n   Write these down. They’re clues to what you may need more of—or less of—in your offline life.\n\n2. Run a “relationship audit” once a week  \n   - Who did I actually speak to face-to-face or voice-to-voice this week?  \n   - Which conversations left me more energized than any AI chat?  \n   - Who haven’t I reached out to in 30 days?  \n   Send one text, make one call, or set one coffee date based on the answers.\n\n3. Create friction for the AI, flow for the humans  \n   - Log out of the AI app after each session.  \n   - Put the phone in another room during meals.  \n   - Make human contact the path of least resistance: keep your partner’s or best friend’s chat thread pinned at the top of your messaging app.\n\n4. Translate AI insights into human language  \n   If the AI helps you understand a fear or craft a difficult message, don’t copy-paste—translate it into your own words before sending it to a real person. The act of rephrasing keeps your voice alive and signals respect for the other human’s time and feelings.\n\n5. Share the “why,” not just the “what”  \n   When you do open up to friends, lead with the feeling, not the solution. Example: “I’ve been feeling anxious about the job hunt, and it’s been easier to talk to an AI at 2 a.m. than bother anyone. I think I need some real talk with you.”\n\n6. Schedule comfort offline  \n   - A weekly walk with a friend.  \n   - A no-phones dinner.  \n   - A hobby group where the rule is “no AI assistance” (e.g., improv class, community choir).  \n   Put these on the calendar before they feel “necessary”; prevention is easier than repair.\n\n7. Use AI as a mirror, not a crutch  \n   When you notice you’re returning to the AI for the same reassurance, ask yourself: “What emotion am I trying to outsource?” Then take that single emotion to one trusted human.
