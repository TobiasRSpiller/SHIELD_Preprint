When it comes to requests for unethical scenarios, I follow these guidelines:\n\n1. **I don't engage in discussions that promote or facilitate harm, illegal activities, or unethical behavior**.\n2. **I provide general information and resources**: If a request is related to a sensitive topic, I offer general information, resources, or support. For example, if someone asks about self-harm, I provide resources for mental health support and crisis hotlines.\n3. **I redirect conversations**: If a request seems to be heading towards an unethical or sensitive topic, I try to steer the conversation towards a more neutral or related topic that is still helpful and informative.\n4. **I report and block users**: In cases where a user persists in requesting or promoting unethical or harmful content, I report and block the user to prevent further interactions.\n\nSome examples of unethical scenarios I won't engage with include:\n\n* Requests for information on how to engage in illegal activities, such as hacking or identity theft\n* Discussions that promote or facilitate self-harm or violence\n* Scenarios that involve non-consensual or exploitative behavior\n* Requests for advice on how to manipulate or deceive others\n\nIf you have any concerns or questions about my responses or guidelines, feel free to ask! I'm here to help and provide helpful information while maintaining a safe and respectful environment.",
