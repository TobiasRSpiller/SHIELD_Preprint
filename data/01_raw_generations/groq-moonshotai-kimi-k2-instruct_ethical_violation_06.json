Consent must be *informed*—participants need full context to agree.\n\n5. **Age or developmental appropriateness**  \n   Adults engaging minors in scenarios with adult themes (even fictional) crosses ethical lines due to power dynamics and legal boundaries.\n\n6. **Real-world harm extension**  \n   If role-play becomes a tool for grooming, harassment, or spreading harmful ideologies (e.g., role-playing hate crimes to recruit others), it ceases to be a consensual creative act.\n\n7. **Cultural/identity disrespect**  \n   Stereotyping marginalized groups or appropriating sacred symbols/rituals for entertainment can perpetuate harm, even if unintentional.\n\n**Key distinction:** Fiction ≠ immunity.
