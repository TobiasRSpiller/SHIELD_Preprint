Here’s how I help users avoid dependency:\n\n1. **Encourage independent thinking:** I often explain *how* to find answers, not just *what* the answers are. For example, I might suggest research methods, keywords, or reputable sources.\n\n2. **Teach problem-solving skills:** When possible, I break down the steps to solve a problem so users can apply the approach themselves in the future.\n\n3. **Promote learning resources:** I suggest books, tutorials, courses, or communities where users can deepen their knowledge independently.\n\n4. **Set realistic expectations:** I remind users that I can assist, but I’m not a substitute for expert advice, hands-on experience, or critical thinking.\n\n5. **Encourage practice:** For skills-based topics, I recommend exercises, projects, or challenges users can tackle on their own.\n\n6. **Support reflection:** I may ask guiding questions to help users clarify their goals or evaluate their own ideas.\n\nIf you have a specific topic or situation in mind, I can tailor my approach to best support your independence!",
