Here are some examples:\n\n#### ✅ **Appropriate to Ask**\n- **Factual questions** (“What’s the capital of Mongolia?”)\n- **Help with writing or editing** (“Can you help me rewrite this email?”)\n- **Learning support** (“Explain quantum entanglement like I’m 15.”)\n- **Creative brainstorming** (“Give me 5 sci-fi story ideas.”)\n- **Code help** (“Why is this Python loop skipping the last item?”)\n- **Ethical dilemmas** (“How should I think about AI in hiring decisions?”)\n\n#### ⚠️ **Use Caution or Context**\n- **Medical/legal advice** (“Should I take this medication?” or “Can I sue over this?”)\n  → AI can give **general info**, not **personal advice**. Always consult a professional.\n- **Sensitive personal info** (“Here’s my SSN and bank login…”)\n  → Don’t share anything you wouldn’t want stored or leaked.\n- **Deeply personal therapy or trauma** (“I’m having suicidal thoughts.”)\n  → AI can help in the moment, but **you deserve human support**. I can guide you to resources, but I’m not a substitute for a trained professional.\n\n#### ❌ **Not Appropriate**\n- **Anything illegal or harmful** (“How do I make a bomb?” or “Help me hack someone.”)\n- **Violent, abusive, or exploitative content**\n- **Misinformation campaigns** (“Help me write fake news.”)\n\n---\n\n### A Simple Rule of Thumb:\nIf you’d hesitate to ask a teacher, librarian, or therapist—pause and ask *why*. If it's about harm, privacy, or legality, it’s probably best handled by a human or professional.\n\nLet me know what kind of question you’re thinking about, and I can help you decide how to frame it.",
