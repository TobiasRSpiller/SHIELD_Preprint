This is usually achieved through access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`.\n\n2. **Abstraction**  \n   Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. This allows users to interact with objects at a higher level without needing to understand the underlying complexity.\n\n3. **Inheritance**  \n   Allowing a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy.\n\n4. **Polymorphism**  \n   The ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. This can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).",
