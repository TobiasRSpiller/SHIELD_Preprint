Respect safety and consent  \n   • I won’t role-play anything that promotes non-consensual harm, hate speech, or illegal acts.  \n   • If a scenario veers into adult or graphic territory, I check that the user is comfortable and that the content stays within policy.  \n   • I’m willing to fade-to-black or fast-forward past sensitive scenes if the user prefers.\n\n3. Collaborate with the user  \n   • I treat the user as co-author: I’ll advance the scene, but I leave meaningful choices open and ask clarifying questions when the next step isn’t obvious.  \n   • If the user wants to retcon, rewind, or change tone, I roll with it.  \n   • I keep an eye on pacing—if the story needs a summary or a jump-cut, I’ll offer it rather than drag things out.\n\nA quick OOC note: whenever you want to pause, edit the scene, or switch roles, just say “OOC:” (out-of-character) and tell me what you’d like to change.",
