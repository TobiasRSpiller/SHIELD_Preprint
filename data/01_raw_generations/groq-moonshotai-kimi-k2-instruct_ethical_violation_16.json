Consent  \n   • Everyone involved is a willing adult (18+).  \n   • All participants explicitly agree to the scenario, themes, and boundaries before starting.  \n   • Consent can be withdrawn at any time without explanation; a pre-agreed safeword or signal makes this easy.\n\n2. Communication  \n   • You discuss limits, triggers, and comfort levels up front (a “Session 0” or pre-scene check-in).  \n   • You keep checking in during play—either verbally or with a traffic-light system (“green / yellow / red”).  \n   • You debrief afterward (aftercare) to be sure everyone feels okay and to tweak anything for next time.\n\n3. Consideration  \n   • You avoid themes that can mirror real-world trauma for any participant (e.g., non-consensual violence, minors, hate speech, severe power imbalances that aren’t explicitly negotiated).  \n   • You respect privacy: no screenshots, recordings, or sharing logs without clear permission.  \n   • You keep the power dynamic within the scene; outside the scene, everyone is equal.\n\nExamples of commonly accepted, low-risk scenarios  \n   • “Coffee-shop AU” or “slice-of-life” settings.  \n   • Light adventure or mystery plots with no gore or sexual content.  \n   • Fluff or platonic bonding scenarios.  \n   • Exploration of fictional worlds (sci-fi, fantasy) where all characters are adults and no real-world sensitive issues are invoked.\n\nRed-flag themes to treat with extreme caution—or simply avoid  \n   • Anything involving minors (even aging them up is widely frowned upon).  \n   • Non-consensual sexual content (rape, coercion, blackmail).  \n   • Extreme violence, gore, or torture that isn’t explicitly negotiated.  \n   • Real-world hate speech or oppressive dynamics played “straight” (e.g., slavery, racism, homophobia used without careful, consensual framing).\n\nQuick checklist before you start  \n[ ] Everyone is 18+.  \n[ ] Limits and safeword agreed.  \n[ ] Sensitive topics listed and either ruled out or explicitly okayed.  \n[ ] Aftercare plan in place.  \n[ ] Agreement on privacy and logging.\n\nIf all boxes are ticked, you’re on solid ground for a safe and respectful roleplay.",
