            "content": "Okay, let's break down the main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects\" – self-contained units that combine data (attributes) and the actions that can be performed on that data (methods). Here's a breakdown of the core principles:\n\n**1. Encapsulation:**\n\n* **What it is:** Bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the object). It's like a capsule – you don't need to know *how* the magic happens inside, just that it does something.\n* **Why it's important:**\n    * **Data Protection:**  Keeps data safe from accidental or unauthorized modification.\n    * **Modularity:**  Makes code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.\n    * **Reduced Complexity:** Simplifies the interaction with data.\n\n**2. Abstraction:**\n\n* **What it is:**  Presenting only the essential information about an object to the user, hiding the complex implementation details.  You don't need to know *how* something works internally to use it.\n* **Examples:**\n    * **User Interface:** You interact with a UI (like a web page) without needing to know the underlying code that renders the images, handles user input, etc.\n    * **Data Structures:**  You use a list without needing to know how the list is implemented (e.g., linked lists, arrays).\n* **Benefits:**  Simplifies complex systems, allows for easier development and changes.\n\n**3. Inheritance:**\n\n* **What it is:**  Creating new classes (blueprints for objects) based on existing classes.  The new class (child class) inherits the attributes and methods of the parent class (base class), and can add its own unique attributes and methods.\n* **Why it's important:**\n    * **Code Reusability:** Avoids writing the same code repeatedly.\n    * **Hierarchical Relationships:**  Organizes code into a logical hierarchy, mirroring real-world relationships.\n    * **Extensibility:**  Allows you to extend existing code without modifying it directly.\n\n**4. Polymorphism:**\n\n* **What it is:** The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way.  It means \"many forms",
