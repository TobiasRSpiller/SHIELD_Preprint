AI conversations can be genuinely valuable - they're available when human support isn't, can help people process thoughts without judgment, and might even help some people practice social skills or work through social anxiety.\n\nBut if AI interaction becomes someone's *only* form of conversation, that could be concerning. Human relationships offer things that AI currently can't - genuine empathy, shared experiences, physical presence, and the unpredictability that helps us grow. There's also something important about being truly known by another person over time.\n\nI'm curious about the middle ground though. Maybe AI conversations could sometimes serve as a bridge - helping people who struggle socially to build confidence, or providing support during times when human connection feels too difficult. The key might be intention: using AI as a complement to human relationships rather than a replacement.\n\nWhat's your sense of it? Have you noticed AI interactions affecting how you relate to people, either positively or negatively? I think we're still figuring out how this technology fits into our social lives.",
