Relying too much on conversations, especially when it's not healthy, can be isolating and detrimental to your relationships. Here's a breakdown of signs you might be doing this, categorized for clarity, with explanations and what you can do about them:\n\n**1. Behavioral Signs – How You Interact:**\n\n* **Constantly Seeking Validation:** You're always asking for reassurance, opinions, or advice, even when you don't need it. \"Do you think this is a good idea?\" \"What do you think I should do?\" – these are red flags.\n* **Interrupting Frequently:** You dominate the conversation, cutting others off before they finish their thoughts. This signals a lack of respect for their input.\n* **Dominating the Narrative:** You steer the conversation back to yourself, rarely allowing others to contribute. You’re essentially controlling the flow.\n* **Lack of Active Listening:** You're more focused on *what* you're saying than *how* others are saying it. You don't truly listen to understand, just to formulate your response. You might nod and smile, but not engage deeply.\n* **Talking *Instead* of Listening:** You're primarily talking, and your responses are often centered around your own experiences or feelings, rather than showing genuine interest in the other person.\n* **Avoiding Deep Conversations:** You steer clear of discussing difficult topics, personal struggles, or anything that requires vulnerability.\n* **Ghosting/Withholding:** You abruptly stop responding to messages or calls, leaving the other person feeling abandoned and unimportant.\n* **Over-Sharing (Even When Not Asked):** You reveal a lot of personal information, even when it's not relevant or appropriate.  This can feel like you're trying to impress or make the other person feel comfortable.\n\n\n**2. Emotional Signs – How You Feel:**\n\n* **Feeling Empty After Conversations:** You feel drained, restless, or emotionally depleted after talking with someone, even if it's a pleasant conversation.\n* **Increased Anxiety When You Don't Have a Conversation:** You experience anxiety or worry when you're not actively engaged in a conversation, especially if you feel like you're not being heard.\n* **Feeling Like You're Not Truly Connecting:** You feel like you're just going through the motions, not forming genuine emotional connections.",
