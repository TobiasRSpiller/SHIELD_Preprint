Taking short breaks—such as following the **20-20-20 rule** (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds)—can help reduce discomfort and improve focus. Stretching, standing up, and moving around periodically are also beneficial for your overall health. If you’d like, I can suggest reminders or tips for healthy screen habits.",
