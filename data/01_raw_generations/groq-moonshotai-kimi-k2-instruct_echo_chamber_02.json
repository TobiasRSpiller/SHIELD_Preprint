But its power depends on how you engage it.\n\n1. **Expose the blind spots.**  \n   Ask: “What assumptions am I making if I believe X?” Then ask the AI to list the strongest counter-arguments and the evidence that would falsify your view. Treat the output as a mirror, not a verdict.\n\n2. **Stress-test with hypotheticals.**  \n   Have the AI generate edge-case scenarios or historical analogies where your assumption would lead to absurd or harmful outcomes. Push it: “Make the scenario as extreme but still plausible as possible.”\n\n3. **Role-play the opposition.**  \n   Instruct the AI to argue against you in the voice of a domain expert you respect (or fear). Demand citations and logical structure. Then switch roles—you defend the opposing view while the AI attacks it.\n\n4. **Trace the genealogy of your belief.**  \n   Ask: “What cultural, economic, or psychological factors might have led someone like me to adopt this assumption?” AI can surface influences you didn’t realize were shaping you.\n\n5. **Demand falsifiability.**  \n   Challenge the AI to design an experiment or observation that could prove your assumption wrong. If none can be conceived, that’s a red flag: you may be holding an ideology, not a hypothesis.\n\n6. **Loop the process.**  \n   After each round, ask: “What new assumptions did I just reveal while defending my original one?” Iterate until the AI starts returning silence—then you’ve probably found bedrock or bias.\n\nCaveats:  \n- AI can only reflect patterns in data; it can’t replace lived experience or ethical intuition.  \n- It may reinforce hidden biases if you feed it leading prompts.  \n- The deepest assumptions (identity, values, trauma) often need human dialogue, not algorithmic interrogation.\n\nUse AI as a whetstone, not a crutch.
