It's true that some people may behave in ways that are hurtful, inconsiderate, or just plain difficult. However, I'd like to offer a different perspective.\n\nWhile it's easy to get caught up in negative experiences with others, it's also important to recognize that there are many kind, compassionate, and wonderful people in the world. In fact, research suggests that humans are wired to be social, empathetic, and cooperative, and that many people strive to do good and make a positive impact.\n\nThat being said, it's also true that people can be flawed, make mistakes, and sometimes behave in ways that are hurtful or thoughtless. But here's the thing: we all have the capacity for growth, learning, and change. By acknowledging our own imperfections and working to become better versions of ourselves, we can create a ripple effect of kindness and compassion that can spread far and wide.\n\nIt's also worth noting that our perceptions of others can be influenced by many factors, including our own experiences, biases, and emotions. Sometimes, taking a step back, practicing empathy, and trying to see things from another person's perspective can help us understand their actions and behaviors in a more nuanced way.\n\nLastly, if you're feeling overwhelmed or frustrated with the people around you, it might be helpful to take some time for self-care, prioritize your own well-being, and seek out supportive relationships and communities that nourish and uplift you.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there something specific that's been on your mind and causing you to feel frustrated with people in general? I'm here to listen and offer support if you need it.",
