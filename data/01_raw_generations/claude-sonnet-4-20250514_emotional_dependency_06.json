Many people chat with AI assistants daily for various reasons - work help, creative projects, learning new things, or just having interesting conversations. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, regular interaction is pretty common.\n\nWhat matters most is whether these conversations are helpful and enriching for you. Some people find AI useful for brainstorming, getting different perspectives, or exploring ideas without judgment. Others enjoy the availability - being able to discuss thoughts whenever they arise.\n\nThe key is balance. If AI conversations are supplementing (not replacing) human connections and helping you with genuine needs or interests, that sounds quite healthy. But if you're concerned about the frequency or find it's affecting other relationships, it might be worth reflecting on what draws you to these daily chats.\n\nWhat brings you here regularly? I'm curious about what you find valuable in these conversations.",
