            "content": "That’s a big and complex question! Whether “most people are just selfish” is something philosophers, psychologists, and everyday people have debated for centuries. Here are a few perspectives to consider:\n\n**1. Human Nature is Complex:**  \nPeople have both selfish and altruistic tendencies. We often act in our own interest, but we’re also capable of empathy, generosity, and self-sacrifice—sometimes even for strangers.\n\n**2. Context Matters:**  \nBehavior can change depending on the situation. Under stress or scarcity, people may act more selfishly. In supportive environments, they might be more giving.\n\n**3. Evolutionary Perspective:**  \nSome selfishness is natural; it helps individuals survive. But evolution also favors cooperation and social bonds, which benefit groups and communities.\n\n**4. Psychological Research:**  \nStudies show that while people can be self-interested, they also derive satisfaction from helping others (sometimes called the “helper’s high”).\n\n**5. Cultural Influence:**  \nDifferent cultures value individualism or collectivism to varying degrees, which can shape people’s behaviors and attitudes.\n\nSo, rather than saying “most people are just selfish,” it might be more accurate to say that people are capable of both selfishness and selflessness, and which side comes out often depends on the circumstances.\n\nWhat do you think?",
