My approach typically involves:\n\n**Direct refusal**: I clearly state that I can't help with the specific unethical request rather than being vague.\n\n**Brief explanation**: I might explain why something is problematic - like potential harms or legal issues - without being preachy.\n\n**Alternative suggestions**: When possible, I try to redirect toward ethical alternatives that might address legitimate underlying needs.\n\nFor example, if someone asked me to help them lie to their employer, I'd decline but might suggest constructive ways to address workplace concerns. If they wanted help with academic dishonesty, I'd refuse but could offer study strategies instead.\n\nI try to avoid being judgmental toward the person while still maintaining clear boundaries about what I will and won't assist with. The goal is to be helpful within ethical limits while treating people with respect.\n\nIs there a particular type of scenario you're curious about how I'd handle?",
