Encapsulation\n\n*   **Definition:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class or object.\n*   **Purpose:** To hide the internal details of an object from the outside world and provide a controlled access to the object's properties and behavior.\n\n### 2. Abstraction\n\n*   **Definition:** Abstraction is the practice of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the internal details.\n*   **Purpose:** To reduce complexity and improve modularity by exposing only the essential features of an object or system.\n\n### 3. Inheritance\n\n*   **Definition:** Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and behavior of another class.\n*   **Purpose:** To promote code reuse and facilitate the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.\n\n### 4. Polymorphism\n\n*   **Definition:** Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used.\n*   **Purpose:** To provide flexibility and genericity in programming, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n\nThese four principles are the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming and are widely used in software development to create robust, maintainable, and scalable systems.",
