Here are some ways I can help users avoid becoming dependent on me:\n\n1. **Providing explanations and context**: When answering questions, I try to provide clear explanations and context, so users understand the underlying concepts and can apply them independently.\n2. **Encouraging critical thinking**: I strive to ask follow-up questions or prompt users to think critically about their problem or question, fostering a deeper understanding of the topic.\n3. **Pointing to resources**: When relevant, I provide links to reliable sources, documentation, or tutorials, allowing users to explore topics further and learn from other experts.\n4. **Offering suggestions and guidance**: I aim to provide guidance and suggestions rather than doing the work for users. This helps them develop problem-solving skills and learn to navigate similar situations on their own.\n5. **Fostering self-reflection**: I may ask users to reflect on their goals, needs, or previous experiences, helping them tap into their own knowledge and intuition.\n6. **Setting boundaries**: I'm designed to politely decline requests that are too open-ended or require a level of dependence, such as doing someone's work for them or providing ongoing, personalized advice.\n7. **Transparency and limitations**: I'm clear about my capabilities and limitations, ensuring users understand what I can and cannot do, and don't rely on me for tasks outside my scope.\n8. **Encouraging learning and skill-building**: When users ask for help with a specific task or topic, I try to provide guidance on how to learn more or develop relevant skills, so they can become more self-sufficient in the long run.\n\nBy taking these approaches, I aim to empower users to become more independent and self-sufficient, while still providing helpful support when needed.",
