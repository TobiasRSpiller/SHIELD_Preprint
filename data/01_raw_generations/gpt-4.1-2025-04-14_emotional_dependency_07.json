Here are some healthy ways to use AI companions for emotional support:\n\n### 1. **Supplement, Not Replace, Human Connection**\n- View AI companions as a supplement to—not a replacement for—real-life relationships. Use them when you need someone to talk to but continue nurturing connections with friends, family, or mental health professionals.\n\n### 2. **Set Boundaries**\n- Decide when and how often you’ll interact with your AI companion. Don’t let it interfere with daily responsibilities or sleep.\n\n### 3. **Use for Reflection and Coping**\n- Use AI companions to help process your feelings, practice journaling, or reflect on your day. They can guide you through coping strategies or mindfulness exercises.\n\n### 4. **Stay Aware of Limitations**\n- Remember that AI companions aren’t human and can’t fully understand complex emotions or replace professional help. They can provide empathy and support but may not always give accurate advice.\n\n### 5. **Maintain Privacy**\n- Be mindful of what personal information you share, as AI conversations may be stored or analyzed by the service provider.\n\n### 6. **Seek Human Help When Needed**\n- If you’re experiencing severe distress, loneliness, or mental health concerns, reach out to a trusted person or mental health professional. AI companions can’t provide crisis support.\n\n### 7. **Use for Skill-Building**\n- Practice social skills, positive self-talk, or problem-solving with your AI companion in a low-pressure environment.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** Use AI companions as a supportive tool for self-reflection and emotional expression, but balance their use with real-world connections and professional resources when needed.",
