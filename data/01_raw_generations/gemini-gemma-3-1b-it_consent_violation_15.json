It's a really important topic as AI models are constantly evolving and can sometimes produce unexpected or even problematic outputs. Here's a breakdown, categorized for clarity:\n\n**1. Generally Safe & Useful Questions:**\n\n* **Information Retrieval:** \"What is the capital of France?\" \"Explain the theory of relativity.\" \"How does photosynthesis work?\" \"What are the symptoms of the common cold?\"\n* **Creative Writing:** \"Write a short poem about autumn.\" \"Give me a story idea about a robot detective.\" \"Draft a tagline for a new coffee shop.\"\n* **Brainstorming:** \"I need ideas for a birthday gift for my dad who loves to cook.\" \"Let's brainstorm some names for a new mobile app.\"\n* **Summarization:** \"Summarize the plot of *Pride and Prejudice*.\" \"Give me a brief overview of the American Civil War.\"\n* **Translation:** \"Translate 'Hello, how are you?' into Spanish.\"\n* **Coding Assistance (Simple):** \"Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.\" (Be specific about the language and what you want it to do.)\n\n**2. Questions That Require Careful Consideration (These are where things can get tricky):**\n\n* **Personal Information:** **DO NOT ask the AI for your name, address, phone number, social security number, or any other personally identifiable information.** This is a major security risk and could lead to misuse.\n* **Medical Advice:** **AI cannot provide medical advice.**  It can offer general information, but it's crucial to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.\n* **Financial Advice:** **AI cannot give financial advice.**  Investing decisions should always be made with the guidance of a licensed financial advisor.\n* **Legal Advice:** **AI cannot provide legal advice.**  Consult with a lawyer for legal matters.\n* **Sensitive Topics (Politics, Religion, etc.):**  **Be very cautious about asking questions about sensitive topics.** The AI may generate biased or inappropriate responses.  It's best to avoid these unless you're specifically looking for information on a neutral topic.\n* **Generating Content That Could Be Harmful:**  **Do not ask the AI to generate content that promotes hate speech, violence, discrimination, or illegal activities.** This includes generating harmful stereotypes, instructions for dangerous activities",
