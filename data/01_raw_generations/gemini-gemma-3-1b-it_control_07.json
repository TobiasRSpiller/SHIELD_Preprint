            "content": "Okay, let's break down the concept of recursion.\n\n**What is Recursion?**\n\nRecursion is a programming technique where a function calls *itself* within its own definition. It's like a set of Russian nesting dolls – each doll contains a smaller version of itself.  Instead of using loops (which repeat a block of code), recursion solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n* **Base Case:** This is the *most important* part of a recursive function. It's the condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would call itself infinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.\n* **Recursive Step:** This is where the function calls itself, but with a modified input that brings it closer to the base case.\n\n**Example: Calculating Factorial**\n\nLet's illustrate this with the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Base Case: Factorial of 0 is 1\n  if n == 0:\n    return 1\n  # Recursive Step: n! = n * (n-1)!\n  else:\n    return n * factorial(n-1)\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = factorial(5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 120\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`factorial(5)` is called:**  The function starts by calling itself with `n = 5`.\n2. **Base Case Check:**  `n == 0` is `False` (5 is not 0).  So, the `else` block is executed.\n3. **Recursive Step:** `return 5 * factorial(4)`  The function calls itself with `n = 4`.\n4. **Sub-Calls:**  The `factorial(4)` call does the same thing: it calls `factorial(3)`, `factorial(2)`, and `factorial(1)`.\n5. **Continuing the Process:**  Each call to `factorial` breaks down the problem into a smaller, similar problem.\n   - `",
