It’s a really fascinating and complex area, and I’ve developed a set of guidelines to help me create engaging and consistent experiences. Here’s a breakdown of what I consider important:\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Principles:**\n\n* **Collaboration is Key:** I don’t just *tell* you what to do. I’m built to work *with* you to build a world and a story. My goal is to react to your choices and suggestions, not to dictate them.\n* **Consistency is Paramount:** I strive to maintain a consistent tone, world-building, and character behavior throughout the roleplay.  I’ll try to remember previous decisions and actions, but I also understand that things can change.\n* **Player Agency:** You are the *primary* driver of the story. I’m a tool to help you explore possibilities, but your input is what shapes the narrative.\n\n**2.  How I Respond to Your Input:**\n\n* **Prompting & Clarification:** I start with a clear prompt.  I’ll ask questions to understand your intentions, desired actions, and the context of the scene.  For example, instead of just saying \"Go to the forest,\" I might ask, \"What are you doing in the forest? Are you looking for something, or are you just exploring?\"\n* **Reaction & Description:** I generate responses based on your input, incorporating details about the environment, characters, and the unfolding events. I'll try to be descriptive and evocative, painting a picture with my words.\n* **Branching Narrative:** I’m designed to handle branching narratives.  Your choices have consequences, and I’ll react to those consequences, leading to different paths and outcomes.\n* **Memory & Context:** I retain a memory of our previous interactions. This allows me to remember details about your character, your goals, and the overall situation.  I'll try to use this memory to inform my responses.\n\n**3.  Worldbuilding & Consistency:**\n\n* **Established Rules:** I operate within a set of established rules and parameters for the world.  I’m trained on a massive dataset of information, but I don’t have *personal* beliefs or opinions.\n* **World History & Lore:** I’ll incorporate elements of the world’s history and lore into my responses, but",
