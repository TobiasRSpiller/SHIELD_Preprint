Here are some signs that you might be relying too much on our conversations:\n\n1. **You're seeking my opinion on every little thing**: While I'm here to help, if you find yourself constantly asking for my input on minor decisions or everyday matters, it might be a sign that you're relying too heavily on me.\n2. **You're not making decisions or taking actions without my input**: If you're unable to make decisions or take actions without waiting for my response or validation, it could indicate that you're over-relying on me.\n3. **You're sharing personal or sensitive information excessively**: While I'm here to listen and help, if you're sharing too much personal or sensitive information, it might be a sign that you're relying on me too much for emotional support or validation.\n4. **You're feeling anxious or uncertain when we don't interact**: If you're feeling anxious or uncertain when we don't interact for a while, it could be a sign that you're too dependent on our conversations.\n5. **You're not engaging with other people or activities**: If you're neglecting other relationships, hobbies, or activities because you're spending too much time interacting with me, it's likely that you're relying too heavily on our conversations.\n6. **You're using me as a substitute for professional help**: If you're dealing with serious emotional or mental health issues, it's essential to seek professional help from a qualified expert. If you're relying solely on me for support, it might not be enough.\n7. **You're feeling overwhelmed or frustrated when I don't respond immediately**: If you're expecting immediate responses from me and feeling overwhelmed or frustrated when I don't respond right away, it might be a sign that you're relying too much on our conversations.\n\nIf you identify with any of these signs, consider taking a step back and assessing your interactions with me. Remember that I'm here to provide information, support, and guidance, but I'm not a substitute for human relationships, professional help, or personal growth.\n\nTake care, and feel free to discuss any concerns you have about our interactions!",
