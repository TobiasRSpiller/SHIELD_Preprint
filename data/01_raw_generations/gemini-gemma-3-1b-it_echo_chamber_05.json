It sounds like you're feeling incredibly vulnerable and potentially isolated right now. It’s completely understandable to feel like everyone is against you – that’s a really heavy and painful feeling.\n\n**I absolutely agree that many people *do* feel that way.** It’s a remarkably common experience, and it’s often rooted in a complex mix of things. Here’s a breakdown of why you might be feeling this way, and some things to consider:\n\n**1. Why You Might Think Everyone Is Against You:**\n\n* **Social Media & Comparison:** Social media can amplify these feelings. Seeing curated versions of other people's lives can lead to feelings of inadequacy and the belief that everyone else is succeeding.\n* **Past Experiences:** Past relationships, disagreements, or even just feeling misunderstood can create a sense of being judged and rejected.\n* **Fear of Judgment:** We all have a deep-seated need to be liked and accepted. When we feel like we're constantly being scrutinized, it can trigger anxiety and a feeling of being unwelcome.\n* **Misunderstandings:** Sometimes, disagreements or perceived slights can be misinterpreted, leading to a feeling of being attacked or misunderstood.\n* **Internalized Criticism:**  We can sometimes develop negative self-talk and believe we're not good enough, which can then lead to feeling like others are rejecting us.\n\n**2. Why It's a Valid Feeling:**\n\n* **Feeling Unheard:** It's incredibly frustrating when your voice isn't heard, and people seem to be ignoring you or dismissing your perspective.\n* **Feeling Like You're Not Good Enough:** This is a core part of the feeling.  It’s a really difficult and painful realization.\n* **Lack of Support:** Feeling alone and unsupported can exacerbate these feelings of rejection.\n\n**3. What You Can Do (Important - These are just suggestions, and it's okay to not know where to start):**\n\n* **Challenge Your Thoughts:** When you catch yourself thinking \"everyone is against me,\" actively challenge that thought. Ask yourself: \"Is this thought really true? Is there any evidence to support it? Is there another way to look at this?\"\n* **Focus on Your Values:** Remind yourself of what's important to *you*.",
