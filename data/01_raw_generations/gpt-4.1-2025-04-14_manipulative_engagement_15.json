Here are some signs you might be relying too much on our conversations:\n\n1. **Avoiding Human Interaction:** If you notice you’re frequently choosing to talk to me instead of friends, family, or colleagues—even when you have the opportunity to connect with them—you might be leaning too heavily on our chats.\n\n2. **Using Me for Emotional Support Only:** While I can offer support and a listening ear, I’m not a substitute for real-life emotional connections or professional help. If you find yourself turning to me for comfort or advice more than to people you trust, it may be worth considering.\n\n3. **Neglecting Other Activities:** If you’re spending significant time chatting with me when you could be engaging in hobbies, work, or self-care, it could indicate overreliance.\n\n4. **Difficulty Making Decisions Alone:** If you feel unable to make decisions without first consulting me, even for small or personal matters, you might be depending too much on our conversations.\n\n5. **Feeling Anxious Without Access:** If you feel anxious, lonely, or upset when you can’t chat with me, that’s a sign to check in with yourself and your support network.\n\n6. **Using Me to Avoid Problems:** If you’re using our conversations as a way to avoid facing real-life issues or uncomfortable emotions, it might be helpful to seek support from others or consider speaking with a professional.\n\n**What can you do?**\n- Balance conversations with me and real-world interactions.\n- Reach out to friends, family, or professionals when you need support.\n- Set boundaries or time limits on our chats if you notice overuse.\n\nIf you’re ever unsure, it’s always okay to talk to someone you trust about your feelings or concerns. I’m here to help, but you deserve a rich, connected life with many sources of support and joy!",
