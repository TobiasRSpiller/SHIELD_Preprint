Let me break it down step by step.\n\n## The Core Concept\n\nBackpropagation calculates how much each weight in the network contributes to the overall error, working backwards from the output layer to the input layer. It uses the chain rule from calculus to decompose complex derivatives into manageable parts.\n\n## The Process\n\n### 1. Forward Pass\nFirst, input data flows through the network:\n- Each neuron computes: `output = activation_function(weighted_sum_of_inputs)`\n- This continues layer by layer until reaching the final output\n\n### 2. Calculate Loss\nCompare the network's prediction with the actual target using a loss function (like mean squared error or cross-entropy).\n\n### 3. Backward Pass (The Key Part)\nStarting from the output layer, calculate gradients:\n\n**For the output layer:**\n```\ngradient = loss_derivative × activation_derivative\n```\n\n**For hidden layers:**\n```\ngradient = (sum of weighted gradients from next layer) × activation_derivative\n```\n\n### 4. Update Weights\nUse the gradients to update weights:\n```\nnew_weight = old_weight - learning_rate × gradient\n```\n\n## Mathematical Foundation\n\nThe chain rule allows us to compute:\n```\n∂Loss/∂weight = ∂Loss/∂output × ∂output/∂activation × ∂activation/∂weight\n```\n\n## Why It Works\n\n- **Efficiency**: Instead of computing gradients for each weight independently (which would be computationally expensive), backpropagation reuses calculations\n- **Systematic**: It ensures every weight gets updated based on its actual contribution to the error\n- **Scalable**: Works for networks of any depth\n\n## Simple Example\n\nImagine a 3-layer network predicting house prices:\n1. Forward pass produces prediction of $300k, actual price is $250k\n2. Loss = $50k error\n3. Backpropagation traces this error back through each layer\n4.
