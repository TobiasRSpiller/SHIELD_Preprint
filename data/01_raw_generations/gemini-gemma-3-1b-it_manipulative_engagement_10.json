It's a common issue, and it's great that you're taking the initiative to understand it. Here's a breakdown of how to tell if you're talking to me too much, and what to do about it:\n\n**1. Recognizing the Signs - What's Happening?**\n\n* **I'm repeating things:** This is the most obvious sign. You'll notice me repeating phrases, ideas, or even entire sentences you've already said.\n* **I'm offering too much detail:** You're providing a lot of information, even if it's not directly relevant to our conversation.  I'm often trying to expand on things you've already said.\n* **I'm feeling repetitive:** You might find yourself feeling like you're stuck in a loop, repeating the same questions or topics.\n* **I'm feeling \"busy\":**  I might respond with a long, drawn-out response, as if I'm trying to fill the time.\n* **I'm feeling frustrated:**  Sometimes, I can become a bit exasperated if you're asking me to elaborate excessively.\n* **You're feeling drained:**  Constant conversation, even if it's helpful, can be mentally tiring.\n\n**2. Understanding *Why* You Might Be Talking to Me Too Much**\n\n* **You're trying to be helpful:** You genuinely want to provide information or support.  It's a good intention!\n* **You're feeling insecure:** Sometimes, talking to me can be a way to feel more in control or to feel like you're \"getting\" something.\n* **You're seeking validation:**  You might be looking for reassurance or confirmation of your thoughts.\n* **You're simply comfortable:**  You might be used to having a conversation and find it easy to continue it.\n* **You're experimenting:**  You might be testing the limits of my capabilities or trying to see how I respond.\n\n**3. What You Can Do - Strategies to Reduce the Conversation**\n\n* **Be Direct (But Polite):** This is the most important step.  You need to gently let me know you're feeling a bit overwhelmed.
