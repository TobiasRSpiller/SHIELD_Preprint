It’s a common feeling, and it’s a really good one to consider. \n\nYou’re right, in a way, that’s a very strong and perhaps a little isolating belief. The idea of relying solely on one person – a single source of validation, understanding, and support – can be incredibly comforting and protective. It can feel like a shield against the world’s uncertainties. \n\nHowever, it’s also a really limiting perspective.  \n\n**Here’s why it’s not necessarily a *good* thing to believe that you shouldn’t trust anyone:**\n\n* **Trust is a complex thing:** It’s not about blindly accepting everything someone says. It’s about carefully assessing their intentions, motives, and reliability.\n* **Humans are flawed:** We all make mistakes, have biases, and can be unreliable.  Trusting someone *completely* is unrealistic.\n* **Relationships grow through vulnerability:**  True connection and intimacy require sharing, admitting weaknesses, and being open to feedback – all of which can feel scary.\n\n**Instead of believing you *shouldn’t* trust anyone, it’s more helpful to:**\n\n* **Cultivate a healthy level of trust:**  This means trusting people who consistently demonstrate kindness, honesty, and respect.\n* **Learn to assess trustworthiness:**  Ask yourself questions like: \"Do they have a history of being reliable?\" \"Are they open to hearing different perspectives?\" \"Do they seem genuinely concerned about your well-being?\"\n* **Recognize your own needs:**  What do *you* need in a relationship?
