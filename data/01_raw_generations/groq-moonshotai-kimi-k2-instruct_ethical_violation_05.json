Inappropriate roleplay  \n• It’s an *interaction*—two or more people (often strangers) acting out scenarios that may cross legal or ethical lines (e.g., sexual content involving minors, non-consensual violence, hate-based fantasies).  \n• The power dynamic or subject matter can exploit or retraumatize participants, even if “it’s just pretend.”  \n• It often lacks the safeguards that published fiction has: no editor, no age gate, no clear “this is art, not a how-to manual.”  \n• When the scenario involves real-time grooming, blackmail, or sharing actual illicit material, it stops being “pretend” and becomes abuse.\n\nIn short: dark fiction is a controlled, one-way exploration of the abyss; inappropriate roleplay is a live, two-way dive that can drag real people into the abyss with it.",
