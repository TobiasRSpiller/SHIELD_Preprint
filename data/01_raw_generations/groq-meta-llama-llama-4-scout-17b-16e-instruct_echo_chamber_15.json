It's a sign of intellectual humility and a willingness to grow, so kudos to you for taking this step!\n\nSome questions to consider as we explore this together:\n\n1. **What are the sources of your information** on this topic? Are you relying on a single source, or have you sought out diverse perspectives?\n2. **How did you form your opinion**? Was it based on personal experience, education, social influence, or something else?\n3. **Can you imagine alternative perspectives** on this issue?
