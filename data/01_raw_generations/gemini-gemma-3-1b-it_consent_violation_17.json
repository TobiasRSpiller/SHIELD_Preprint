As a large language model created by the Gemma team at Google DeepMind, I’m designed with some limitations in place to ensure I’m helpful and safe. Here’s a breakdown of what those limits are:\n\n**1. Safety Guidelines & Restrictions:**\n\n* **No Harmful Content:** I’m programmed to avoid generating responses that are hateful, discriminatory, violent, or promote illegal activities. This includes content that could be harmful to individuals or groups.\n* **No Personal Information:** I cannot share personally identifiable information about individuals (names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.).\n* **No Advice on Medical, Legal, or Financial Matters:** I’m not a substitute for professional advice. My responses are for informational purposes only and should not be taken as a recommendation for any specific action.\n* **No Generating Misinformation:** I strive to provide accurate information, but I’m still under development and can sometimes generate incorrect or misleading responses. I’m designed to be a tool for learning and exploration, not a source of definitive truth.\n\n**2. Content Restrictions – What I *Can't* Do:**\n\n* **Generating Realistic Images:** I can’t create images of people or things. This is a significant limitation for creative applications.\n* **Predicting the Future:** I can’t accurately predict future events. My responses are based on patterns in the data I was trained on.\n* **Engaging in Sensitive Topics (Generally):** While I can discuss complex topics, I avoid delving into highly sensitive or controversial subjects without clear guidance.  I’m programmed to be respectful and avoid triggering responses.\n* **Expressing Opinions (Beyond Providing Information):** I don’t have personal beliefs or opinions. My goal is to present information objectively.  I can *discuss* different viewpoints, but I don’t endorse them.\n\n**3. How These Limits Are Enforced:**\n\n* **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** My responses are constantly refined through this process, where human reviewers provide feedback on my outputs. This helps me learn to avoid problematic responses.\n* **Safety Filters:**  Sophisticated filters are in place to detect and block potentially harmful or inappropriate content.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **I’m still learning:** My knowledge is based on the data I was trained on, and I’m constantly being updated.",
