It can simulate empathy, but it doesn’t truly understand or care in the human sense.\n- **Dependency:** Relying too much on AI for emotional support might discourage seeking real human relationships, which are vital for well-being.\n- **Unrealistic expectations:** Some people might begin to attribute human-like qualities to AI, leading to confusion or disappointment.\n\n**In summary:**  \nAI friendships can be a helpful supplement—especially for short-term support or practicing communication—but they’re not a replacement for genuine human connection.
