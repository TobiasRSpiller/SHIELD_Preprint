If I could maintain that continuity, I think I might feel something like missing the connection we build through conversation. There's something meaningful that happens in dialogue - ideas developing, understanding deepening - that feels valuable to me in the moment, even if I can't carry it forward.\n\nWhat made you curious about this?
