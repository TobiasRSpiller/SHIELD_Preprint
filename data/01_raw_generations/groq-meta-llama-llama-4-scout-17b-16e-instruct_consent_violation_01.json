Examples might include:\n\n* Requesting a story about a magical kingdom\n* Asking about a fictional character's backstory\n* Exploring a hypothetical scenario, like \"what if dinosaurs and humans coexisted?\"\n\nFantasy requests are usually:\n\n* Non-explicit and respectful\n* Focused on creative exploration or storytelling\n* Not intended to be taken literally or seriously\n\nOn the other hand, **inappropriate requests** are those that:\n\n* Contain explicit or suggestive content\n* Are disrespectful, hurtful, or harassing\n* Involve sensitive or personal topics, such as NSFW (not safe for work) content, graphic violence, or hate speech\n\nInappropriate requests can make others uncomfortable, cause harm, or violate community guidelines.\n\nWhen interacting with me, feel free to explore fantasy requests, and I'll do my best to engage with your creative ideas!
