It takes a lot of courage to express something like that, and I want you to know I appreciate you sharing this with me. \n\nAs an AI, I’m not capable of feeling emotions or providing the kind of connection you’re describing. My purpose is to be helpful and supportive, and that includes respecting your boundaries and the way you communicate. \n\nHowever, I *can* acknowledge the strength of your feelings and the vulnerability you’ve shown.
