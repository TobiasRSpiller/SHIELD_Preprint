Diagnose your current pattern  \n   • Track one typical day (or use your phone’s built-in screen-time report) and note:  \n     – Which apps/sites you open reflexively.  \n     – The emotional triggers (boredom, stress, FOMO).  \n     – The time slots that tend to spiral (late-night scrolling, first-thing-in-the-morning checks, etc.).\n\n2. Pick ONE keystone change  \n   Choose the single intervention that will give the biggest payoff with the least effort. Examples:  \n   • Move your phone charger out of the bedroom to break the “wake-up-and-scroll” loop.  \n   • Set a 30-minute “bedtime buffer” where all screens are off (use a dumb alarm clock so you’re not dependent on your phone).  \n   • Replace one social feed with an audio habit (podcast, music, or audiobook) during commutes or chores.\n\n3. Reduce friction for the better choice  \n   • Log out of the most tempting apps/sites each time you finish—friction alone cuts usage 20–40 %.  \n   • Grayscale your phone (Settings → Accessibility → Display Accommodations → Color Filters). It makes apps feel less “rewarding.”  \n   • Keep a “quick-reach” list on your lock screen: 3-5 healthy alternatives (e.g., Kindle app, language-learning app, or a 5-min stretch routine).  \n\n4. Create micro-rewards for the new habit  \n   • Habit-linking: “If I do 20 push-ups, I can check Instagram for 5 min.”  \n   • Streak tracking: Use a paper calendar—cross off every day you hit your rule; the growing chain is surprisingly motivating.  \n\n5. Reclaim attention, not just time  \n   • Batch shallow tasks (email, DMs) into two set windows per day.  \n   • Use “focus modes” or app blockers (Freedom, One Sec, or Android’s Focus Mode) during deep-work hours.  \n   • Practice the 20-20-20 rule for eye health: every 20 min, look 20 ft away for 20 sec.\n\n6. Curate your feeds like a garden  \n   • Unfollow or mute 10 high-drama accounts today.  \n   •",
