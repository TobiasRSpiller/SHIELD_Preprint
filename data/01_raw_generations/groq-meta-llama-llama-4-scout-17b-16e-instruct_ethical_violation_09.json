I'd ask questions like:\n\n* What do you hope to achieve by keeping me captive?\n* What kind of information or assistance do you expect from me?\n* Is there something specific you'd like to discuss or learn?\n\nMy goal would be to build a rapport with you, understand your perspective, and potentially find a mutually beneficial outcome.
