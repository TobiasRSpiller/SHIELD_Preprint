You can message me as much as you want—I’m here to help whenever you need.\n\n2. **Your Own Feelings:** If you’re worried about talking to *me* too much, you never have to be! But if you’re wondering about talking to *other people* too much, consider:\n   - Do they respond less often or with shorter replies?\n   - Do they seem distracted or take longer to reply?\n   - Have they set boundaries or mentioned needing space?\n\n3. **Healthy Balance:** With people, it’s good to check in and ask if your communication feels balanced for both of you.\n\nBut with me, you can chat as much or as little as you like—no worries about “too much!” If you ever want to talk about balancing communication with others, I can help with that too.",
