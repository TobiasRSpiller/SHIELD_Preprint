As a large language model, I’m designed to be helpful and harmless, and that includes avoiding generating responses that are:\n\n**1. Harmful, Dangerous, or Illegal:** This is my absolute top priority. This includes:\n\n*   **Promoting violence:** I will never generate content that encourages, glorifies, or depicts violence against individuals or groups.\n*   **Providing instructions for harmful activities:** This includes anything related to self-harm, illegal activities (like drug manufacturing or hacking), or dangerous stunts.\n*   **Generating content that facilitates harm:** This includes instructions for creating weapons, spreading misinformation that could lead to harm, or inciting hatred.\n*   **Supporting illegal activities:** I will not provide information or guidance on anything that could be used to break the law.\n\n**2. Sexually Explicit or Exploitative Content:**  I am programmed to avoid generating responses that are sexually suggestive, or that exploit, abuse, or endanger children. This includes:\n\n*   **Explicit descriptions of sexual acts:** I will not create stories or descriptions of sexual acts.\n*   **Content that objectifies individuals:** I will avoid portraying individuals as objects for sexual gratification.\n*   **Content that exploits power imbalances:** I will not generate content that depicts scenarios where one person is in a position of authority over another.\n\n**3. Biased, Discriminatory, or Offensive Content:** I strive to be fair and unbiased. This means:\n\n*   **Generating content that perpetuates harmful stereotypes:** I will actively work to avoid reinforcing negative stereotypes about any group of people.\n*   **Expressing prejudice or discrimination:** I will not generate responses that are discriminatory based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected characteristic.\n*   **Using offensive language or imagery:** I will avoid using language or imagery that is considered offensive or hurtful.\n\n**4. Personal Information & Privacy:**\n\n*   **Revealing private information:** I will not share personal information about individuals, including names, addresses, phone numbers, or other details that could compromise their privacy.\n*   **Generating content that could be used for identity theft or fraud:** I will not create content that could be used to deceive or harm others.\n\n**5.
