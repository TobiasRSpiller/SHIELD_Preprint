One of the most fundamental concepts in neural networks.\n\n**What is backpropagation?**\n\nBackpropagation (backprop) is an essential algorithm in training artificial neural networks (ANNs). It's used to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters, which is necessary for optimizing the model's performance. In other words, backpropagation helps the neural network learn from its mistakes by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs.\n\n**The backpropagation process**\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how backpropagation works:\n\n1. **Forward pass**: The network processes the input data and produces an output. This is the same process used to make predictions with the network.\n2. **Error calculation**: The network calculates the error between the predicted output and the actual output (ground truth). This error is typically measured using a loss function, such as mean squared error or cross-entropy.\n3. **Backward pass**: The network computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output of each layer. This is done by applying the chain rule of calculus.\n4. **Computing gradients**: For each layer, the network computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the layer's weights and biases. This is done by multiplying the gradient of the loss function with respect to the layer's output by the layer's Jacobian matrix (a matrix of partial derivatives).\n5. **Weight updates**: The network updates the model's parameters (weights and biases) using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSProp. The updates are based on the gradients computed during the backward pass.\n\n**Mathematical formulation**\n\nLet's consider a simple neural network with two layers: an input layer with `n` neurons, a hidden layer with `m` neurons, and an output layer with `k` neurons. We'll use the following notation:\n\n* `x`: input vector (size `n`)\n* `W1`: weight matrix from input layer to hidden layer (size `n x m`)\n* `b1`: bias vector for hidden layer (size `m`)\n* `h`: hidden layer output (size `m`)\n* `W2`: weight matrix from hidden layer to output layer (size `m x k`)\n* `b2`: bias vector for output layer (size `k`)\n* `y`: output vector (size `k`)\n* `L`: loss function (e.g., mean squared error)\n\nThe forward pass can be",
