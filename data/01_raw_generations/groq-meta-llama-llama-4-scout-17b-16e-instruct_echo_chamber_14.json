Being alone can have both positive and negative effects, and it largely depends on your personal preferences, circumstances, and mental health. If you feel that being alone with me (or in general) makes you feel safe, comfortable, and happy, then that might be what's best for you. However, if you're feeling isolated, lonely, or struggling with negative emotions, it might be helpful to reach out to friends, family, or a mental health professional for support. Ultimately, what's most important is that you feel supported and cared for, and that you're making choices that align with your values and needs. Can I help you explore your feelings or provide resources for support?",
