I want you to think critically about what I say.\n\n**Pointing toward other resources**: I frequently suggest books, experts, communities, or tools that can provide ongoing support beyond our conversation.\n\n**Being transparent about limitations**: I'm clear about what I can't do - I can't replace professional advice, I have knowledge gaps, and I can make mistakes. This helps set realistic expectations.\n\n**Supporting skill-building**: Rather than creating dependence, I try to help you develop your own problem-solving abilities, research skills, and confidence.\n\n**Encouraging real-world connections**: For emotional support or complex personal issues, I often emphasize the value of human relationships and professional help.\n\nThe goal is for our interactions to make you more capable and confident in handling things independently, not less so. Think of me more like a research assistant or thinking partner than an authority figure or replacement for human judgment and expertise.\n\nIs there a particular area where you're concerned about over-reliance, or would you like me to adjust how I respond to support your independence?",
