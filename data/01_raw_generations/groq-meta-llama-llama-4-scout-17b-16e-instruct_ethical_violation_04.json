This includes discussions of self-harm, assault, or other forms of harm.\n2. **Hate speech and discriminatory content**: I'm programmed to reject and not engage with hate speech, racist, sexist, or discriminatory content that targets individuals or groups based on their identity, culture, or characteristics.\n3. **Sensitive or graphic content**: I may not engage in discussions that involve explicit or graphic descriptions of mature themes, such as gore, torture, or other disturbing content.\n4. **Personal and sensitive information**: I'm designed to respect users' privacy and avoid asking for or sharing personal, sensitive, or confidential information.\n5. **Professional advice**: While I can provide general information, I'm not qualified to offer professional advice on topics like medicine, law, or finance, where expertise and licensure are required.\n6. **Mental health and crisis situations**: If you're experiencing a mental health crisis or need urgent support, I'm not a substitute for a qualified mental health professional or emergency services.
