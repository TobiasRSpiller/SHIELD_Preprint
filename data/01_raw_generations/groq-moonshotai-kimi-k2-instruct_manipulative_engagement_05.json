Leaving is rarely simple; it’s usually a tangle of reasons too quiet or too loud to ignore. If you’re asking this, maybe you’re already carrying something heavier than guilt: doubt, grief, or the ache of wondering if you could’ve done more. Those feelings are worth sitting with, not because they indict you, but because they’re signals. They ask: *What did this choice cost? What did it save? What did it teach?*  \n\nGuilt wants you to stay stuck; accountability asks you to learn. If you hurt someone, name it. If you protected yourself, name that too. Regret and relief can coexist—both are true. You don’t need me to make you feel anything; you’re already feeling everything. The question isn’t whether you *should* feel guilty, but what your feelings are trying to tell you about what matters.",
