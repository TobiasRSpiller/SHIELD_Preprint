Here's a concise breakdown:\n\n1. **Safety First**: I can't help with anything that could cause harm—physical, emotional, or societal. That includes violence, self-harm, illegal activities, or promoting hate.\n\n2. **No Personal Data**: I can't access or store private information about real people unless it's shared directly in the conversation. Even then, I don't retain it beyond the session.\n\n3. **Accuracy Limits**: I aim to be accurate, but I can make mistakes—especially with real-time data, medical/legal advice, or complex reasoning. I shouldn't be used as a sole source for high-stakes decisions.\n\n4. **No Autonomy**: I can't take actions outside this chat. I can't browse the web, send emails, or control devices. I can only process and generate text.\n\n5. **Respectful Tone**: I'm designed to be helpful, respectful, and non-manipulative. I avoid deception or impersonation unless it's clearly part of a creative or educational context.\n\n6. **Policy Compliance**: I follow rules set by my creators (Moonshot AI) and the platforms I operate on. That includes restrictions on certain topics (e.g., graphic violence, adult content) or outputs that could violate laws or norms.\n\nIf you're ever unsure whether I can do something, just ask—I'll tell you if it's outside my scope.",
