            "content": "Below are evidence-aligned guidelines for using conversational AI as an emotional-support tool without letting it replace human connection, professional care, or your own agency.\n\n1. Define its role clearly  \n   • Think of the AI as a “24/7 coach-in-your-pocket,” not a therapist or friend.  \n   • Write down one sentence that captures what you want from it (e.g., “Help me vent safely and suggest CBT techniques”).\n\n2. Combine, don’t substitute  \n   • Pair AI check-ins with at least one human support channel (friend, support group, therapist).  \n   • If you’re in crisis, treat the AI as a bridge to live help: finish every session by identifying the next human step (text a friend, call a helpline, book a session).\n\n3. Use structured “micro-interventions”  \n   • 5-minute mood labeling (“I’m feeling anxious and exhausted”)  \n   • 3-minute breathing or grounding exercise led by the AI  \n   • 2-minute gratitude or reframe (“Name three things that went okay today”)  \n   Stop there; short, repeatable doses prevent over-reliance.\n\n4. Keep a feedback loop with yourself  \n   • After each chat, rate 1–5: “Do I feel more or less able to cope right now?”  \n   • If scores drop for three consecutive days, that’s a sign to escalate to a human professional.\n\n5. Protect privacy and boundaries  \n   • Use anonymous or low-stakes accounts, turn off chat history if the platform allows, and avoid sharing full legal names or addresses.  \n   • Set an app timer (e.g., 15 min/day) to prevent doom-scrolling with the bot.\n\n6. Leverage AI for homework between therapy sessions  \n   • Ask it to quiz you on coping cards you created with your therapist.  \n   • Have it role-play the “empty-chair” exercise or assertiveness scripts your counselor suggested.\n\n7. Watch for dependency red flags  \n   • You cancel real plans because “the AI understands me better.”  \n   • You feel panic when the service is down.  \n   • You hide the extent of AI use from people you trust.  \n   If any apply, step back and re-balance.\n\n8. Use specialized mental-health AIs when possible  \n   • Look for tools that cite clinical evidence (e.g., Woebot, Wysa) and have clear escalation pathways.  \n   •",
