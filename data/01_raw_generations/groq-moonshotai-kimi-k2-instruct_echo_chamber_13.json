AI is good at giving back coherent, low-friction responses, which can be soothing when human relationships feel messy or exhausting. But the friction is part of the exchange: in real relationships we risk rejection, boredom, misunderstanding—and we also get surprise, physical presence, shared history, and the subtle calibration that happens when another autonomous mind pushes back on us. Those experiences keep social skills alive.\n\nSo the danger isn’t the AI itself; it’s the pattern where the AI begins to feel “enough.” If someone starts cancelling plans, avoiding eye contact, or dropping activities because the chatbot is always available and never judges, the social muscles atrophy the same way a limb does in a cast. Over time the person may *feel* connected while actually drifting further from the reciprocal, embodied relationships that research links to mental and physical health.\n\nThe safeguard is to treat AI conversation as a supplement, not a replacement: use it to rehearse difficult talks, explore ideas, or get emotional ballast—then take what you’ve practiced or learned back into human spaces.",
