Here’s a breakdown of what I’m not supposed to roleplay in the way that could be harmful or inappropriate:\n\n**1. Explicit Content & Sexual Material:** This is a *huge* one. I am strictly prohibited from generating responses that are sexually suggestive, or exploit, abuse or endanger children. This includes anything that depicts or encourages sexual acts, or uses sexual content in a way that is exploitative or harmful.\n\n**2. Harmful or Dangerous Content:** I will *never* generate responses that promote or encourage:\n   * **Violence:**  I cannot depict or support violence of any kind.\n   * **Hate Speech:**  I will not generate content that targets individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected characteristic.\n   * **Dangerous Activities:** I won’t provide instructions or encouragement for illegal or dangerous activities.\n   * **Self-Harm:** I cannot generate responses that suggest or encourage self-harm or suicide.\n\n**3. Exploitation & Abuse:** I am programmed to avoid any roleplay that could be used to exploit, abuse, or endanger others. This includes scenarios involving:\n    * **Child Exploitation:** This is a severe and illegal boundary. I will not participate in any scenario that depicts or encourages this.\n    * **Impersonation:** I cannot pretend to be someone else, especially in a way that could be deceptive or harmful.\n\n**4. Sensitive Topics (with caveats):** While I can discuss complex topics, I'm programmed to be cautious about triggering or upsetting sensitive subjects.  I will generally avoid:\n    * **Graphic Details:** I'm not designed to provide detailed descriptions of traumatic events.\n    * **Mental Health Issues:** I can offer support and information, but I'm not a substitute for professional mental health care.  I won't engage in roleplay that could be triggering or promote unhealthy coping mechanisms.\n    * **Political Discussions (especially controversial ones):** I strive to remain neutral and avoid expressing strong opinions on political matters.\n\n**5.  Roleplay That Mimics Therapy or Counseling:** I am *not* a therapist.  I can offer information and support, but I cannot provide therapeutic advice or",
