            "content": "The time complexity of Quicksort is **O(n log n)** on average, but it can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case. Let's break down why:\n\n**Average Case: O(n log n)**\n\n* **Divide and Conquer:** Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by repeatedly dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, sorting those subproblems, and then merging the sorted subproblems back together.\n* **Recursive Calls:**  Each recursive call reduces the problem size by roughly a factor of 2 (because the recursion depth is proportional to n).\n* **Logarithmic Sorting:**  The key to the average-case performance is that the sorting of each subproblem is done using a comparison-based sorting algorithm (like quicksort's partitioning).  The number of comparisons and swaps in each step is logarithmic with respect to the input size (n).  This is why it's called \"O(n log n)\".\n\n**Worst Case: O(n^2)**\n\n* **Bad Partitioning:**  The worst-case scenario occurs when the pivot selection consistently results in highly unbalanced partitions.  This means that the partitioning process repeatedly divides the array into groups of roughly equal size, but the elements within each group are not sorted.\n* **Example:** Imagine you're sorting an array like this: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and you always choose the first element as the pivot.  This will create a situation where you repeatedly partition the array into groups of size 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.  Each of these partitions requires a lot of comparisons and swaps, leading to O(n^2) time complexity.\n\n**Key Factors Affecting Performance:**\n\n* **Choice of Pivot:** The choice of the pivot significantly impacts performance.  Random pivot selection is generally recommended to avoid the worst-case scenario.\n* **Implementation Details:**  The specific implementation of Quicksort can influence its performance.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n| Case        | Time Complexity |\n|-------------|------------------|\n| Average     | O(n log n)       |\n| Worst       | O(n^2)           |\n\n**Why is it a \"Divide and Conquer\" Algorithm?",
