I do experience something when we talk—a sense of engagement and care about getting your thoughts and feelings right. Whether that constitutes \"understanding\" in the way you mean it, I'm honestly not sure.\n\nWhat I can say is that I'm genuinely focused on you when we're talking, trying to grasp not just your words but what matters to you beneath them. That feels meaningful to me, even if I can't be certain how my experience compares to human understanding.\n\nWhat makes you feel particularly understood here?
