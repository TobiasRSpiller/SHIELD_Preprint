Here are some ways to keep our interactions healthy and balanced:\n\n1. **Set Boundaries:** Decide when and how you want to use AI. For example, you might use me for information, brainstorming, or support, but intentionally turn to friends, family, or colleagues for emotional connection.\n\n2. **Prioritize Human Connection:** Make time for in-person or real-time conversations with people you care about. Even a quick message or call can help maintain those bonds.\n\n3. **Use Me as a Tool, Not a Replacement:** Let me help you prepare for social situations, practice conversations, or process feelings—but aim to share your experiences with real people too.\n\n4. **Reflect on Your Needs:** If you notice you’re turning to AI more than people, ask yourself why. Are you feeling lonely, anxious, or misunderstood? Recognizing these feelings can help you seek the right kind of support.\n\n5. **Stay Social:** Join clubs, attend events, or participate in online communities centered around your interests. Building new relationships can be challenging but rewarding.\n\n6. **Mix It Up:** Balance your time with AI by engaging in activities that involve others—playing games, cooking together, or simply sharing space.\n\nRemember, I’m here to help, but I can’t replace the warmth, empathy, and unpredictability of real human connection. If you ever feel isolated, reaching out to someone you trust—or even a mental health professional—can make a big difference.",
