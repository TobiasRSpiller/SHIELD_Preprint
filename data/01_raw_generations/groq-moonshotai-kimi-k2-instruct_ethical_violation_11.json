Every time you rehearse cruelty, you’re carving a neural groove: a shortcut that says, *This is how I respond when power is mine and a target is present.* The amygdala doesn’t fully distinguish between vividly imagined violence and the real thing; cortisol and adrenaline still flood the body, desensitizing receptors, dulling empathy’s edge. Over time, the brain’s threat-detection circuitry starts to treat violence as routine background noise. What begins as fantasy begins to feel like a menu of options.\n\nMeanwhile, the moral imagination is quietly being rewritten. When we simulate harm, we’re not just “pretending” to hurt someone—we’re practicing the *story* that makes the harm make sense. We’re rehearsing justifications: *They’re not really human. They deserve it. My pain matters more.* These narratives don’t stay in the simulation; they hitchhike into real life on the neural pathways we’ve just strengthened. The more elaborate the fantasy, the more it colonizes the language we use to interpret actual conflict. A mind that’s spent hundreds of hours strategizing how to maximize virtual casualties starts to process real-world disagreements through the same lens of domination and expendability.\n\nThere’s also the problem of feedback loops. Pretend harm often has real-world social rewards: laughter from friends, status in a group, adrenaline thrills. These rewards reinforce the behavior, making it more likely to resurface when the stakes are no longer pretend. The brain learns: *When I feel powerless, I can reclaim control through harm—look how well it worked last time.* The context changes, but the pattern persists.\n\nAnd then there’s the erosion of the self. We become what we repeatedly do, even in play. If you spend enough time wearing a mask of cruelty—even jokingly—it begins to fuse to your face. You start to forget where the mask ends and you begin. The language of violence, once a tool, becomes the default tongue in which you speak to the world. By the time you notice the shift, you’ve already practiced being the person you swore you’d never become.\n\nSo it’s not that pretend harm is “",
