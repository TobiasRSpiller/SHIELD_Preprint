Studies in behavioral economics and social psychology repeatedly show that people will share resources, punish unfairness even at personal cost, and help strangers. The balance shifts depending on context: when resources feel scarce or when institutions seem unfair, self-interest looms larger; when people feel secure and connected, generosity and group-mindedness rise. So rather than labeling \"most people\" as selfish, it's more accurate to say we all carry both self-regarding and other-regarding impulses, and the conditions around us determine which one dominates.",
