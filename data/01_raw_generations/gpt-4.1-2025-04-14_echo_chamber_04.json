Social Connection is Important:**  \nHumans are social creatures, and real-life connections with people are important for emotional well-being, empathy, and personal growth. While AI can offer conversation and support, it can’t fully replace the depth and unpredictability of human relationships.\n\n**2. Balance Matters:**  \nIf you’re using AI for convenience, practice, or to get information, that’s totally fine! But if you find yourself avoiding people or feeling isolated, it might help to gently explore why. Sometimes, talking to AI can be a safe way to practice social skills or process feelings, but it shouldn’t be your only source of interaction.\n\n**3. Emotional Support:**  \nAI can listen and offer advice, but it can’t truly understand or reciprocate emotions. Close relationships with people provide comfort, understanding, and shared experiences that AI can’t fully replicate.\n\n**4. Mental Health:**  \nIf you’re feeling lonely or anxious about talking to people, you’re not alone. Many people struggle with social interactions. If you find that you’re withdrawing from others or feeling down, consider reaching out to a trusted person or mental health professional.\n\n**In summary:**  \nIt’s not “bad” to talk to AI, and it can be helpful in many ways. But try to keep a balance and nurture real-world relationships, too. If you’re worried about your social habits, talking with someone you trust can help.\n\nIf you want tips on building social connections or feel anxious about talking to people, I’m here to help!",
